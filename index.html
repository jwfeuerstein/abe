      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p class="lead">Abe was started by a pair of lawyers and a computer scientist, with a common goal</p>
      <p>The idea was to make legal services more affordable and more available. Our idea was incubated in the Summer 2019 cohort of Startup School, a program created by Y Combinator. This venture capital fund was created to help early stage startups become billion dollar companies.  Their big successes include AirBnB, DoorDash, and Dropbox. After completing Startup School, Abe secured funding from a former PayPal executive, Wanji Walcott. Wanji is now Chief Legal Officer for a Fortune 500 Company. With her funds, we are working daily to make legal services easier and more affordable for you to use.</p>
